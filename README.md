Employee Performance Analysis

Project Summary

This project aims to analyze and predict employee performance based on various workplace factors such as department, job role, environment satisfaction, salary hikes, and work-life balance. The goal is to provide insights that can help organizations improve workforce efficiency and employee satisfaction.

Objectives

Identify key factors affecting employee performance.

Develop a machine learning model to predict employee performance ratings.

Visualize trends in performance across different departments and roles.

Create an interactive Streamlit app for real-time analysis and predictions.

Approach

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming data using Pandas and NumPy.

Feature Engineering: Selecting the most relevant variables impacting performance.

Model Training & Evaluation:

Tried multiple ML algorithms (XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression).

Tuned hyperparameters to achieve the best accuracy.

Insights Generation:

Used correlation analysis to determine the impact of salary hikes, work-life balance, and promotions.

Identified the top 3 most important factors influencing employee performance.

Deployment:

Built a Streamlit web app where users can input employee details and receive performance predictions.

Included interactive charts and visualizations for better data interpretation.

Key Findings

Work environment satisfaction, salary hikes, and work-life balance are the top contributors to employee performance.

Employees with longer tenure but fewer promotions tend to have lower performance ratings.

The model achieved over 90% accuracy in predicting employee performance.

Technologies Used

Python: Data analysis and machine learning.

SQL (Optional): For structured data storage.

Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib: Data processing and visualization.

Scikit-Learn, XGBoost: Model training and evaluation.

Streamlit: Interactive dashboard development.

Future Improvements

Expand dataset with real-world employee feedback.

Integrate a recommendation system to suggest improvements for underperforming employees.

Implement deep learning models for more precise predictions.

Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into employee performance trends and offers a predictive tool for HR professionals. By analyzing workplace factors, companies can implement strategic improvements to enhance productivity and employee satisfaction.
